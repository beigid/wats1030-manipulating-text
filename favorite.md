In comparison to the other editors, I found Emacs to be the best. Initially I know it is easy to say that you can assume your first new anything will be your favorite, however, once I got the hang of navigating, and how the C command refers to control, I felt better know that I had a lot more autonomy and manipulation as to how the text editor works and utilizes commands. Nano was also a very simple interface and initially easy to navigate through, but I found the simplicity of it to also reflect a GUI with how simple it was and I was not too excited by it. Vi was a hard learning curve when initially switching between the edit mode and the viewing mode, and I was not specifically enjoying that interface as much to edit and move files with. I found myself running into trouble here and there when I would hit a command by accident and need to quit, but in all it was a great learning experience and I got to have a fun time moving through files and editing while also learning new commands and becoming faster at the commands I had previously used. Also, I was actually able to make tetris mode work, and that was a lot of fun to mess around with! I absolutely enjoy this editor over the others.
